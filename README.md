# Project Description

Our project is the development of an online weather application that provides users with both current and historical weather data. The application aims to offer an intuitive and informative platform for users to access weather forecasts, historical weather patterns, and climate changes over time. This will be achieved through a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of obtaining precise weather updates and historical data analysis.

## User Requirements

Users will be able to:

- View current weather conditions for a specified location.
- Access historical weather data for different time frames (daily, monthly, yearly).
- Compare weather conditions across different periods.
- Receive notifications for severe weather alerts in chosen locations.
- Customize the display settings to show preferred weather information.

## Functional Requirements

The system will:

- Fetch and display current weather data from a reliable API.
- Store and retrieve historical weather data from the database.
- Implement a search function for users to find weather information by location.
- Provide graphical representations of weather data for easy comparison.
- Ensure data accuracy and update weather information in real-time.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The application will load current weather data within 2 seconds.
- **Usability**: The interface will be intuitive, requiring minimal to no instruction for new users.
- **Reliability**: The application will have an uptime of 99.9%, with real-time updates.
- **Security**: User data and preferences will be securely stored and not shared without consent.
